# ALU_SMS (School Management System)  
## Project Overview
The **School Management System (SMS)** is a Python,, text/cmd-line menu-driven application aimed at improving administrative efficiency within ALU educational system. The system allows users to manage various aspects of school operations, including student enrollment, record management, grade tracking, and CGPA calculation. This tool is especially suited for use in a text-based environment and is designed to operate without a graphical user interface.

## Project Purpose
This project focuses on streamlining administrative processes and providing a centralized way to manage student data effectively. The SMS will be utilized by facilitators to:
- Register and update student records.
- Input and manage student grades.
- Calculate and display each student's CGPA based on formative and summative assessments.

## Key Features  
1. **Student Enrollment and Records Management**: Facilitators can register new students, entering required details such as name, ID, year, and trimester. The system validates entries to ensure accuracy.  
2. **Records Update**: Facilitators can search for and update existing student records, including contact information and grades, with quick access to records by student ID or name.  
3. **Grade Input and Update**: Facilitators can enter individual student grades for various assessments, ensuring grades are within accepted parameters to prevent errors.  
4. **CGPA Calculation**: The system calculates the CGPA for each student based on formative (quizzes, assignments) and summative assessments, providing an accurate measure of academic performance.  
5. **View Grades**: Students can view a summary of their grades for each module and their overall CGPA.

## Interface and Interaction  
The SMS application is a terminal-based system with a user-friendly menu for selecting operations.  
### Main Menu Options:
1. **Student Enrollment** - Register new students with their personal and academic details.
2. **Manage Student Records** - Update or modify student details and view enrolled students.
3. **Grade Input** - Enter and update student grades.
